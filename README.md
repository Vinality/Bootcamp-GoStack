# Bootcamp-GoStack
6-Week long, intensive bootcamp provided by Rocketseat with the intent of learning the stack:

<strong>NodeJS, React and React Native</strong>

# Table of Contents:
1. [Node.js](#NodeJS)
    * [Module 1](#Module1)
    * [Module 2](#Module2)
    * [Module 3](#Module3)
      

# NodeJS
## Module 1 <a name="Module1"></a>
This module consists of learning basic NodeJS concepts using Express and Nunjuck to build HTTP routes and Middlewares.

What I learned:
* Introduction to Node.js
* Introduction to the MVC architecture
* Introduction to Nunjucks template language for views
* Passing data to views

### Exercise
The exercise consisted of developing an application which receives an age value and redirects the user to a different route depending on the input value.

## Module 2 <a name="Module2"></a>
This second module consists of building a appointment scheduling application for a barber shop in which users can register as both barbers or clients and schedule an appointment with a barber.

What I learned:
* User authentication
* User sessions
* Template Language (Nunjucks)
* Redirecting routes
* Password encryption
* Sequelize ORM for PostgreSQL
* Moment for date management

### Exercise
The exercise for module 2 consisted on adding a schedule list feature in which barber accounts could check their appointments on any day.

## Third Module <a name="Module3"></a>
In the third module we built a marketplace REST API where users can list items for sale and buy items.

What I learned:
* User auth/sessions
* JWT Auth
* REST API
* Mongoose ORM for MongoDB
* Query filters
* Express handlebars
* Environment Variables
* Sentry.io

### Exercise 
In this exercise we had to add a feature to the API where a vendor could create an offer on an ad, followed by the buyer accepting the offer. The ad should, then, be updated as sold and should no longer show up on the listings (since it is now marked as sold).
